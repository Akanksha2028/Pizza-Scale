# **Pizza Sales Analysis Project in Power BI**

## **Problem Statement**

The project leverages sales and product data to identify:
1. **Best-selling pizza types** and their corresponding sales figures.
2. **Sales trends over time** to identify periods of high and low demand.

The analysis also includes visualizations that can help decision-makers track and improve sales performance.
